# SeaPP

Our own language compiler developed that executes .spp files. It has the basic functionalities of any coding language like C, C++. 
Done as an evaluative under the course - CS F363 COMPILER CONSTRUCTION as a course project in BITS Hyderabad.

To execute the .spp files -

gcc main.c
./a.exe or ./a.out
enter file name: here you can enter *hello.spp* which is the hello.spp file in the current directory or you can also enter *test_suite/hello.spp* which is a file in test_suite directory

Thank you for using the .spp compiler.
